# ETL-Programs  
**Transforming extracted data using SQL queries & loading it onto a table or file**  
*(All programs written in Python, primarily focusing on ETL logic.)*

---

## 🧩 Introduction  
This project showcases how to **extract, transform, and load (ETL)** data using Python.  
It demonstrates working with structured data files (like CSV and JSON), applying SQL-style transformations, and loading the results into tables or output files.  

The aim is to simulate real-world data workflows — from reading input data, performing cleansing, filtering, and aggregation, to applying business logic and writing processed outputs for reporting and analytics.

## 📂 Repository Structure  

### 🧠 Programs  

#### **Airline_info.py**  
- Analyzes airline dataset.  
- Extracts and transforms flight and customer details.  
- Generates summarized insights on routes, timings, and performance.

#### **Banking_customers_info.py**  
- Processes banking customer data.  
- Performs segmentation and computes new financial metrics.  
- Loads cleaned data for further reporting.

#### **Dept_and_employee_info.py**  
- Works with departmental and employee records.  
- Demonstrates data joins, filters, and aggregate operations across datasets.

#### **Employee_info_check.py**  
- Performs data quality checks on employee datasets.  
- Flags missing, inconsistent, or invalid entries.

#### **Plan_info.py**  
- Analyses subscription/plan information for service-based datasets.  
- Evaluates usage, pricing, and revenue metrics.

#### **Telecom_info.py**  
- Tailored for telecom datasets.  
- Analyzes customer usage patterns, churn indicators, and service plan data.

*(Additional scripts and helper utilities are also included in the repository.)*

## 📊 Datasets  

Various folders and sample data files accompany the scripts.  
They include structured JSON, CSV, and TXT data for testing ETL operations.

Examples:
- **`employee_data_100/`** – Employee records for transformation and validation.  
- **`departments/`**, **`customers/`**, **`telecom_data/`** – Domain-specific sample datasets.  
- **`Employees Aged Over 45.csv`**, **`Selected_Employees.txt`** – Example outputs generated by scripts.

Each Python file specifies which dataset it uses in its comments or at the top of the code.

## ⚙️ Getting Started  

### ✅ Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- Basic libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `csv`, `json`, depending on the script)  
- Input data files must be located in the correct directories before running any script.

### ▶️ How to Run
